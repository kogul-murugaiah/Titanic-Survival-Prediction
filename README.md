# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Abstract:

The Titanic Survival Prediction project employs a logistic regression model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and understand the factors contributing to survival during the historic maritime disaster. The logistic regression model is trained on the Titanic dataset, containing information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. By utilizing this dataset, the project aims to accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not. Furthermore, a web page has been developed to provide an interactive interface for users to input passenger information and receive survival predictions instantly.

## Web Page Description:

The web page designed for the Titanic Survival Prediction project provides an intuitive interface for users to predict the survival of passengers. Users can input various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more, and the logistic regression model will predict whether the passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster or not. The web page ensures ease of use, making it accessible for anyone interested in exploring the data and predictions.

## Features of the Web Page:

1. **Input Fields:**
   - Pclass (Ticket class: 1, 2, or 3)
   - Sex (Male or Female)
   - Age
   - SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
   - Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
   - Ticket Fare
   - Embarked (Port of Embarkation: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
   
2. **Predict Button:**
   - Clicking this button triggers the logistic regression model to make a prediction based on the input provided by the user.

3. **Prediction Result:**
   - The prediction result will be displayed below the input fields, indicating whether the passenger would have survived or not.

## Project Overview:

The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict the survivability of passengers using logistic regression. The logistic regression model is trained using the Titanic dataset, which includes passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, etc. The model predicts the probability of survival for each passenger based on the features available.

The web page interface provides an easy-to-use platform for users to interact with the model. Users can input the relevant information and receive instant predictions. This project not only provides an insight into the factors affecting survival on the Titanic but also demonstrates the application of machine learning in historical data analysis.
